## Options type

Options to control pattern compilation.

Currently, only a language option is supported, defaulting to 'xsd'. Set this to 'xpath' to compile the pattern with XPath syntax and semantics. Note that not all XPath-specific features are currently supported. See https://github.com/bwrrp/xspattern.js/issues/9 for details.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type Options = {
    language: 'xsd' | 'xpath';
};
```
